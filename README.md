<ul><li>This is a website that can be used to plan your adventures.</li><li> We can register and login with a username and password and start exploring !! But this currently is only like a prototype of a travel website.</li><li> This is the first ever website I created and the main purpose was to learn how to use html templates to create a website and how to input or update data by being an admin or an owner.</li><br> 
<li>This website is created using python with Django framework.</li><li>I used MVT architecture as the design pattern.</li><li> XAMPP server is used to maintain data using phpMyAdmin which is used for managing the MySQL database.</li>
</ul>
