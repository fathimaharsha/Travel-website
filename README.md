# Travel-website
Here is the link to checkout the website : http://travelapp11.pythonanywhere.com/<br><br>
<ul><li>This is a website that can be used to plan your adventures.</li> We can register and login with a username and password and start exploring !! But this currently is only like a prototype of a travel website. This is the first ever website I created and the main purpose was to learn how to use html templates to create a website and how to input or update data by being an admin or an owner.<br> 
This website is created using python with Django framework.I used MVT architecture as the design pattern. XAMPP server is used to maintain data using phpMyAdmin which is used for managing the MySQL database.
